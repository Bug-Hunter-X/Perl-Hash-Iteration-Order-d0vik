This repository contains an example of an uncommon bug in Perl related to hash iteration order. The bug.pl file demonstrates the issue, and the bugSolution.pl file provides a solution.  Perl's hash iteration order is not guaranteed to be consistent across different Perl versions or even different runs of the same program. This can be problematic if your code relies on a specific order of elements. This example highlights this behavior and offers ways to maintain a predictable ordering if needed.
